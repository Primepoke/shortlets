# shortlets
A webapp for renting, listing, and managing shortlets

The project comes in two phases.
Phase one is now complete and basically demonstrates the functionalities of the project.

It currently includes property listing, viewing, booking, payment, search functionality, reviews and responses to reviews, and many more. But currently uses basic bootstrap to demostrate it works. Nothing pretty or fancy.

In phase 2 I'll work on the templates (UI/UX) to make it look good and incorporate interactivity through bootstrap. I'll finalize work the reports app for reporting incidents within the apartments or with a manager or renter.
